**Accelerating Large-Scale Out-of-GPU-Core GNN Training with Two-Level Historical Caching** (Accepted by APPT 2025)

HCGNN is a high-performance system for training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on large-scale graphs that exceed GPU memory capacity. It introduces a novel two-level historical caching mechanism that dramatically reduces I/O overhead during GNN training by leveraging historical access patterns from previous training epochs.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Two-Level Historical Caching**: Innovative caching strategy combining neighbor cache and feature cache
- **Out-of-GPU-Core Training**: Handle graphs that exceed GPU memory capacity
- **Reduced I/O Overhead**: Significant reduction in data movement between CPU and GPU
- **High Performance**: Substantial speedup over existing GNN training systems
- **Easy Integration**: Built on top of Quiver and PyTorch Geometric
- **Multi-Dataset Support**: Tested on large-scale datasets including ogbn-papers100M, ogbn-products, Friendster, and IGB-medium

## 🔧 System Architecture

HCGNN builds upon **Quiver** and **Ginex** systems and implements a sophisticated two-level caching mechanism:

### 1. Neighbor Cache
- Caches frequently accessed graph neighborhoods
- Reduces graph sampling overhead
- Uses historical access patterns to predict future neighborhood accesses

### 2. Feature Cache  
- Caches node feature vectors based on access frequency
- Implements intelligent cache replacement policies
- Optimizes memory usage with historical access statistics

### 3. Cache State Simulation
- Three-pass algorithm for optimal cache management:
  - **Pass 1**: Calculate access frequency and initial cache indices
  - **Pass 2**: Build data structures for cache simulation (iterptr & iters)
  - **Pass 3**: Compute changesets for cache updates

### Caching Algorithm
HCGNN implements a sophisticated three-pass caching algorithm:

1. **Pass 1 - Frequency Analysis**: Analyzes historical access patterns to determine which nodes/features to cache
2. **Pass 2 - Data Structure Construction**: Builds efficient data structures (`iterptr`, `iters`) for cache simulation
3. **Pass 3 - Changeset Computation**: Computes optimal cache update strategies

### Memory Management
- **UVM (Unified Virtual Memory)**: Enables efficient CPU-GPU memory sharing
- **Memory Mapping**: Uses memory-mapped files for large feature matrices
- **Lazy Loading**: Loads data on-demand to minimize memory footprint

### Graph Sampling
- **GPU-accelerated Sampling**: Leverages Quiver's UVA-based graph sampling
- **Neighborhood Caching**: Caches frequently sampled subgraphs
- **Adaptive Batch Sizing**: Optimizes batch sizes per dataset
